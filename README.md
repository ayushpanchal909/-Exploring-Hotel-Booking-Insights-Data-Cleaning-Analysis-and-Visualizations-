## Hotel-Booking-Analysis

In this project, I began by importing hotel booking datasets from a CSV file. I then focused on refining the data quality through techniques like handling invalid entries and applying filters. With a cleaner dataset, I delved into descriptive analysis. 

I created a visual representation of the number of guests per country on a map, giving insight into the diverse origins of hotel guests. A pie chart illustrated the distribution of bookings across different market segments, providing an overview of the hotel's clientele composition.

Further, I developed a bar chart that showcased the average price per night (ADR) for various room types within each market segment. This graphical comparison allowed for a quick understanding of pricing trends among different types of guests.

To comprehend guest trends over time, I utilized a line chart to exhibit the number of guests arriving on each date. This chart helped in identifying peak periods and lulls in hotel occupancy.

Lastly, I analyzed the distribution pattern of guest arrivals. The insights gained from this analysis aided in understanding the spread of guest check-ins over different time periods.

In conclusion, the project encompassed importing, cleaning, and analyzing hotel booking data. The visualizations offered a comprehensive overview of guest demographics, market segments, pricing, and temporal trends, contributing valuable insights for informed decision-making in the hotel management realm.
