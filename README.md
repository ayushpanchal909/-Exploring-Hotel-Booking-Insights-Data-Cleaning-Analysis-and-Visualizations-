## Exploring Hotel Booking Insights: Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualizations

In this project, I began by importing hotel booking datasets from a CSV file. I then focused on refining the data quality through techniques like handling invalid entries and applying filters. With a cleaner dataset, I delved into descriptive analysis. 

I created a visual representation of the number of guests per country on a map, giving insight into the diverse origins of hotel guests. A pie chart illustrated the distribution of bookings across different market segments, providing an overview of the hotel's clientele composition.

Further, I developed a bar chart that showcased the average price per night (ADR) for various room types within each market segment. This graphical comparison allowed for a quick understanding of pricing trends among different types of guests.

To comprehend guest trends over time, I utilized a line chart to exhibit the number of guests arriving on each date. This chart helped in identifying peak periods and lulls in hotel occupancy.

Lastly, I analyzed the distribution pattern of guest arrivals. The insights gained from this analysis aided in understanding the spread of guest check-ins over different time periods.

In conclusion, the project encompassed importing, cleaning, and analyzing hotel booking data. The visualizations offered a comprehensive overview of guest demographics, market segments, pricing, and temporal trends, contributing valuable insights for informed decision-making in the hotel management realm.

### Objective of Analysis

>Which countries demonstrate the highest guest arrival rates, as depicted in the world map chart?

>What is the distribution of discrepancies between assigned and reserved room types, as depicted in the cross-tab chart?

>How is the distribution of hotel bookings across various market segments and How does the average price per night (ADR) vary for different room types across all market segments

>What does the distribution chart of guest arrivals reveal about the frequency and pattern of guest check-ins?

The cross-tabulation chart presents the relationship between assigned and reserved room types. It reveals interesting patterns in room assignments. For instance, when comparing assigned room type A with reserved room type L, there are 17 instances where L is assigned, indicating an inconsistency. Generally, room types A and D are frequently assigned across various reserved room types. Room types E and F tend to be swapped, as indicated by the nonzero values in their intersections. This data highlights the discrepancies and preferences in room assignments, providing insights into operational practices and potential areas for improvement in the hotel's room allocation process.

The distribution of booking counts across different market segments reveals varying levels of demand. "Online TA" and "Offline TA/TO" show the highest booking counts, indicating significant customer engagement through these channels. In contrast, "Aviation" and "Undefined" segments demonstrate notably lower demand. This insight sheds light on effective marketing strategies and target audience preferences.

The provided data represents a distribution of numerical values. The values seem to be related to some parameter or attribute. From a quick overview, it's evident that the distribution ranges widely, with values as low as 2 and as high as 323. The dataset shows a variety of values clustered at different levels, indicating potential trends or patterns. However, without more context about the nature of these values or the context they belong to, it's challenging to draw specific insights. Further analysis, such as measures of central tendency or visualization, could provide a clearer understanding of the distribution's characteristics and potential implications.
